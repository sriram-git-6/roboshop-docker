# docker-compose up -d ---> creates all the above containers
# after creating the containers, login into roboshop app and order any product.
# now delete all the above resources using docker-compose down command.
# docker-compose up -d ---> creates the containers again.
# now login into the roboshop app and find your order id still exists because of the volumes that we have 
# attached to the containers.
